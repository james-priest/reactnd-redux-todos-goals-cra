# React Redux Todo & Goals App

This is a proof-of-concept React Redux Todo app. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses Redux store to provide the following:

- state tree
- getState() - retrieve state
- subscribe() - listen for changes to state
- dispatch() - update state

The app also uses reducers, actions, and action creators in order to manage state properly.

## Installation

The package includes dev libraries to provide linting and code formatting as well as additional react & redux libraries. These can be installed with the following:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

The app can be run with the following command.

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the site in development mode at the following URL.

- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
